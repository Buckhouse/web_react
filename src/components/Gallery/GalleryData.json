The lead is advanced with a push-activated clutch system. Here I’ve painted a small portrait of the Fixpencil, but instead of using it to draw itself (which felt too on the nose). I’ve rendered it in watercolor using a narrow mongoose-haired brush. Somehow the blue watercolor was a better match for the myth that surrounds this particular writing tool.",
