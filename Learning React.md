Learning React

I have been creating html css js sites now for a while. I want to switch to react. Help me learn to do it.

I want to be able to make reusable componets.
I want to be able to design in Figma and build in react
I want to be able to call APIs
I want to take user input from a editable text field and call APIs that take that data.
I want to be able to launch an agent, which sometimes takes a while, so I need some sort of job handling like redis (or something more modern)
I want to be able to build styled components in react, but i dont know how the css gets added in.

PLease help me create a base project.
